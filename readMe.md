# Data visualization with small multiples

The R package ggplot2 really shines when it comes to produce small multiples charts (faceting). This repository contains code + data to reproduce the chart in the 'output' folder.

This chart is a reproduction of a chart publish in [this interesting article] (http://www.excelcharts.com/blog/animation-small-multiples-growth-walmart-excel-edition/) about using animations versus small multiples.
